# Smart-IOT-and-ML-based-Vaccine-Storage-System

The "Smart IoT and ML-based Vaccine Storage System" project is a pioneering initiative designed to revolutionize the way vaccines are stored, monitored, and managed. Leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML), this project aims to address the critical challenge of ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of vaccines throughout the cold chain supply, from production to administration.
